Let's think about a particle on a ring winding a constant magnetic flux. Although it is a simple QM problem, it can be viewed as a concise example that features properties of topological terms.

Denoting position along the ring of an electron as $$\phi(\tau)$$, function of the imaginary-time $$\tau$$, action of an electron coupled with $$A$$ (vector along the ring) is

$$S[\phi]=\int_0^\beta L d\tau = \int_0^\beta \left(\frac{1}{2}m\dot{\phi}^2-\frac{i}{2}eA\dot{\phi}\right) d\tau. \tag{1}$$ 

Then, by variation of $$S$$ classical equation of motion,

$$ \frac{\delta S}{\delta\phi}=0 \Rightarrow \ddot\phi=0, \tag{2}$$

is obtained. Since angular component of a Lorentz force vanishes, the electron should move with a constant velocity along the ring.

During the process, we could observe that the second term in the Lagrangian, $$-\frac{i}{2}eA\dot{\phi}$$, does not influence the equations of motion. It means that the term does not vary with local variations of $$\phi(\tau)$$.
